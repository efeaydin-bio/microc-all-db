# Chromatin Interaction Database of BCP ALL

This web application presents a database of chromatin interactions identified through Micro-C experiments on **35 primary B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL)** samples.

Users can explore chromatin loops:
- Around specific **genomic coordinates**
- For the cis-regulatory elements of selected **genes of interest**
- Across **BCP ALL subtypes**
- In a **high-resolution merged map (1 kb resolution)**
